# DiscordBot_Bones
This repository is meant to host some files I have constructed for an open source Discord bot.  The bot is primarily useful for Roleplay scenarios, including an 'objective maker' and a simple 'dice roller'.  There should be plenty of notes available in the code to learn from the setup.

-----

Make sure that prior to running the bot, you have installed the Discord API packages.
As a brief reminder...

LINUX Terminal:
> python3 -m pip install -U discord.py

WINDOWS Powershell/Command Prompt:
> py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
