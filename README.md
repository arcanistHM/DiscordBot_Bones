# DiscordBot_Bones
This repository is meant to host some files I have constructed for an open source Discord bot.  The bot is primarily useful for Roleplay scenarios, including an 'objective maker' and a simple 'dice roller'.  There should be plenty of notes available in the code to learn from the setup.
